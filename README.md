## üìñ Overview

The goal of this project was to develop a full end-to-end machine learning application that:
- Trains a linear regression model on housing data
- Exposes predictions through a Flask API
- Accepts user input via a responsive frontend
- Is deployed and accessible publicly via an AWS EC2 instance

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Modeling (Jupyter Notebook)**  
   A linear regression model is trained on Southern California housing data using `scikit-learn`.

2. **Backend (Flask)**  
   A simple REST API is built to serve predictions from the trained model using user-provided features.

3. **Frontend**  
   The user can input features like square footage, location, and more into an HTML form styled with CSS and JS.

4. **Deployment**  
   All components are deployed to an Ubuntu server on AWS EC2. Flask is served behind NGINX, and GitHub is used for version control.
